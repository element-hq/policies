When you read 'Element' or 'the App' it refers to the Element chat App, an open source Matrix client which you can use to connect to any server that implements the Matrix protocol.

Where you read *Element* (trading name of New Vector Ltd.), or *we* or *us*, it refers to New Vector Ltd., and its French subsidiary: New Vector SARL and their agents.

If this agreement is not acceptable, please use a Matrix client provided by someone else!

### 1.2 Using The Service Means Accepting These Terms

By accessing or using the App in any way, wherever their account is hosted, if they are are just browsing rooms as an unauthenticated guest, the User agrees to and is bound by the Users Terms.

### 1.3 This Is a Living Document

### 1.4 Breach of Terms

If the User breaches any of the terms and conditions in this document, and the breach is not cured within fifteen (15) days after we provide notice of the breach your authorization to access and use the App automatically terminates.

## 2. Intellectual Property Rights

### 2.1 Who Owns the IP of The Authorised User's Messages and Files?

Unless stated otherwise in other agreements, the User can not claim intellectual property rights over rooms, message content or files Users uploaded via the App.

The User acknowledges and agrees that Element have no liability of any kind should any Users gain access to their messages or files modify, destroy, corrupt, copy or distribute them, or violate the terms of use or other limitations that the Users may impose on the use of their shared content.

Users are solely and entirely responsible for all of the messages and files that they post or otherwise submit via the App. Users shall assume all risks associated with the use of said content including any reliance on the accuracy, completeness or usefulness. Element does not guarantee the accuracy, integrity or quality of their messages or files.

As part of the User Terms, Users acknowledge and agree that by accessing or using the App, they may be exposed to user materials from others that are offensive, indecent or otherwise objectionable.

## 3. Use of The App

The User must comply with these User Terms. We may review the users' conduct for compliance purposes, but we have no obligation to do so. We are not responsible for the content of the User's data, or the way the Users decide to use the App.

Users are required to at least 16 (sixteen) years old to use the App or such greater age required in their country to register for or use the App.

We are not responsible for providing internet connectivity to the Users for the use of the Services.

Any illegal content, and in particular any content containing or promoting indecent images/depictions of children, are utterly prohibited on the App. When the User becomes aware of such content, they are responsible for reporting it to us so we can refer the details to the relevant authorities. If the Customer has found an account, room or group being used for the distribution or promotion of child sexual exploitation or any illegal content, please share the details in an email to [abuse@element.io](mailto:abuse@element.io).

If we believe that there is a violation of these terms, which can be simply remedied by the removal of some of the User's data, or by disabling a third-party product, or if we believe there is a credible risk to harm us, the App, Users or any third parties, we will directly take what we believe is the appropriate action.

## 4. Our Responsibilities

### 4.1 Provide the Services

We are responsible for providing the Service as described in the introduction of this document.

### 4.2 Uptime

We do not guarantee that the Service will be accessible at all times. Like all other cloud-based applications, we are vulnerable to the inherent unreliability of the Internet.

We will use commercially reasonable efforts to make the Services available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, excluding planned downtime. We expect planned downtime to be infrequent but will endeavor to provide the User with advance notice (e.g., through the Service), if we think it may exceed five (5) continuous minutes.

You acknowledge and agree that Element shall not be liable for any failure to access the App at any time.

### 4.3 Data Protection and Processing

We will ensure to set-up, at a minimum, reasonable data practices for maintaining the confidentiality and security of the Customer's and User's Data and preventing unauthorized access. For more details please check our [Privacy Policy](https://element.io/privacy_policy) and [Cookie Policy](https://element.io/cookie_policy).

## 6. Support

Support is available by email to [support@element.io](mailto:support@element.io). Queries will be addressed according to priority levels which are solely defined by Element.

Phone support is not yet provided.

## 7. App Developers

We encourage everyone to write software that uses the Matrix Protocol and interfaces with the App.

The Matrix Protocol and our implementation will change over time, and we may change or deprecate APIs or behaviour for any feature of the App from time to time - it is the Application Developer's responsibility to ensure that calls or requests they make to or via our Service are compatible with then-current APIs for the App. We will always try to inform the Application Developer of any changes with reasonable notice so they can adjust their Application, but we are under no obligation to do so.

## 8. Termination of Use

The Customer can terminate their use of the Service at any time.

## 9. Encryption

The App may allow the Authorised Users to encrypt their communications end-to-end between devices. There may be restrictions and limitations on the import, possession, use, transfer and/or export of strong encryption technology under the laws of the country in which the Users intend to use the Communication Service. It is the User's sole obligation and responsibility to check such restrictions and limitations before using the App and to comply with them. We reserve the right to suspend the Service immediately and without notice if we determine, in our sole judgment, that the Service is being used in violation of local regulations governing the use of cryptographic technologies (even though we have no responsibility to make such determination).

## 10. Warranties and Disclaimers

The App is provided by Element under these terms of use "as is" without warranty of any kind, either express, implied, statutory or otherwise, including, but not limited to, the implied warranties of title, non-infringement, merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose.

Subject to your acceptance, and compliance, with this Agreement, Element hereby grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable, non-sublicensable licence, in and under our intellectual property rights, to access and use the Service, solely in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Unless explicitly stated otherwise, any new features provided by us that augment or enhance the current Service shall also constitute "Service" and shall be subject to these terms and conditions. All rights not expressly granted under this Agreement are retained by Element.

You may also be subject to additional terms and conditions that may apply when you use other Element services, third party content or third party software.
